 *  \ingroup    fwk
 *  \brief      Specifies the publish-subscribe interface.
 *  \details    This module addresses the specific issue of how to notify a
 *              set of interested active objects (clients) in a timely way
 *              that a value that they care about has changed, especially when
 *              the notification process is to be repeated for a relatively
 *              long period of time. It does this without requiring the data
 *              server to have any a priori knowledge about its clients.
 *              The basic solution offered by PubSub module is to have the
 *              clients "subscribe" to the server to be notified about the
 *              value in question according to the policy: "when the value
 *              changes", receiving a proper event carrying the value of
 *              interest.
 *              This means, for example, that sensor data can be easily shared
 *              to elements that may not even exist when the sensor proxies
 *              are written.
 *              Also, minimizes computational effort for notification of
 *              clients and across a communications bus and minimizes the bus
 *              bandwidth required for notification of the appropriate clients.
