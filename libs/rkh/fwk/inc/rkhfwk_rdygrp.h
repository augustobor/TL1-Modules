/**
 *  \brief
 *	SMA ready table.
 *
 *  Each SMA is assigned a unique priority level between 0 and
 *  RKH_LOWEST_PRIO.
 *  Each SMA that is ready to run is placed in a ready list consisting of two
 *  variables, rkhrg.grp and rkhrg.tbl[]. SMA priorities are grouped
 *  (8 SMA per group) in rkhrg.grp. Each bit in rkhrg.grp is used to
 *  indicate whenever any SMA in a group is ready to run. When a task
 *  is ready to run it also sets its corresponding bit in the ready table,
 *  rkhrg.tbl[]. The size of rkhrg.tbl[] depends on RKH_LOWEST_PRIO
 *  (see rkhcfg.h).
 *
 *  SMA's priority = | 0 | 0 | Y | Y | Y | X | X | X |
 *
 *  Y's:	bit position in rkhrg.grp and
 *          index into rkhrg.tbl[RKH_LOWEST_PRIO / 8 + 1]\n
 *  X's:	bit position in rkhrg.tbl[RKH_LOWEST_PRIO / 8 + 1]
 *
 *  The lower 3 bits (X's) of the SMA's priority are used to determine the
 *  bit position in rkhrg.tbl[], while the next three most significant bits
 *  (Y's) are used to determine the index into rkhrg.tbl[].
 *
 *  To determine which priority (and thus which SMA) will run next, the
 *  scheduler determines the lowest priority number that has its bit set in
 *  rkhrg.tbl[]. The relationship between rkhrg.grp and rkhrg.tbl[] is
 *  given by the following rules:
 *
 *  Bit 0 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[0] is 1.\n
 *  Bit 1 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[1] is 1.\n
 *  Bit 2 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[2] is 1.\n
 *  Bit 3 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[3] is 1.\n
 *  Bit 4 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[4] is 1.\n
 *  Bit 5 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[5] is 1.\n
 *  Bit 6 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[6] is 1.\n
 *  Bit 7 in rkhrg.grp is 1 when any bit in rkhrg.tbl[7] is 1.
